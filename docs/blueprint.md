- Body text: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to give both a modern look and some warmth or personality. Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif to maintain a professional but technical aesthetic suitable for the technology-adjacent subject of the site.
- Use clean, professional icons related to Amazon, marketing, and business to enhance visual communication without detracting from the site's content.
- Employ a clear, consistent layout across all pages to improve user experience. This design focuses on simple navigation to allow easy traversal between pages. Content is carefully arranged and aligned with standard website formats.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to add polish and professionalism, maintaining a fast and responsive user experience.
